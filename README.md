<h1>Virtual Mouse</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Virtual Mouse project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to enable cursor control using hand gestures. This innovative solution replaces the need for physical mouse hardware, offering a contactless and intuitive user interface. The project utilizes Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI modules to achieve real-time hand tracking, gesture recognition, and cursor movement simulation.</p>
