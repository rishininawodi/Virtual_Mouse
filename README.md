<h1>Virtual Mouse</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Virtual Mouse project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to enable cursor control using hand gestures. This innovative solution replaces the need for physical mouse hardware, offering a contactless and intuitive user interface. The project utilizes Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI modules to achieve real-time hand tracking, gesture recognition, and cursor movement simulation.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li> <b>Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition:</b> Uses MediaPipe to accurately detect and track hand movements, identifying specific gestures like pointing, clicking, and dragging.</li>
<li> <b>Real-Time Cursor Control:</b> Integrates PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse actions based on hand gestures, enabling smooth and precise control of the cursor.</li>
<li><b>Video Processing with OpenCV:</b> Employs OpenCV for real-time video capture and processing, ensuring low latency and high responsiveness.</li>
<li><b>Customizable Gestures:</b> Users can define and customize gestures for different mouse actions, allowing a personalized user experience.</li>
